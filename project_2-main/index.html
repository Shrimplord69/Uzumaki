                              After many discussions, we came up with a team name in the Japanese language. “Uzumaki” means a whirlpool containing different elements inside it but always moving together. The initial concept of this name is for our prototype as it is a marketplace that gathers several sellers on a platform but all share the same targeted segmentation. However, the name also has a special meaning representing our team nature. Even though we have members from different majors, different educational backgrounds and ages, we are all willing to work together and support each other to come up with the possible ideas and best outcome. By doing that, we understand each member's weaknesses and strengths to contribute the right value thriving on advantages as a team.

Ha broke down the project into stages for easy following tasks with the support from Vu. In this Assignment, we should have improved on our time management, but we do not have the intention to change any working roles because everyone was ready to contribute their best in any allocated tasks.

                <h1>Dang Kim Quang Minh </h1>
                <h2 style="text-align:center ;">(s3938024)</h2>
                <p class="ppp">I am Minh, currently an Uzumaki member and a freshman student at University, in my first semester ever in higher
                    education. To be honest, I am very excited about diving into the world of IT. I am profound with technology as a
                    consumer but not on a technical engineering level. I am a shy person, to say the least, but I have spent one month
                    studying overseas and that helped me overcome my weaknesses and gave me more confidence in communicating with
                    strangers and in public speaking.
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching videos. I also play sports, basketball although not very
                    good at it. However, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, whenever we play sports together and talk with them at
                    cafes. I also like doing puzzles and questioning everything. To me, questioning is a good start in IT. It is easy to
                    see that the phone has developed due to the human desire for communication, the more people keep questioning
                    themselves about how to commute in distance, the closer the creation of the phone calling system in the human being.
                    Hence, I think this has driven me to the IT field with exploration and a ready-to-do mindset.
                    My goal is to become a developer, with expertise in both front-end and back-end, and find my place in the working
                    world. I want to work as a team player anytime and anywhere I choose to go, thereby I have to improve my overall
                    flexibility. To me, flexibility is required for my future job because a developer always needs to do a lot of
                    debugging or create new project ideas whenever the client asks for them. To have a deep understanding of the IT
                    world and to explore and innovate, I strongly believe studying at school and equipping fundamental knowledge is not
                    enough, hence, I plan to work outside of the school in the IT field during my junior or senior year to expand
                    practical knowledge and to experience the actual works of a developer.
                    Talking about experiences in IT, to be honest not much, but I know my way around technologies and I do learn very
                    fast, so I believe that after finishing my education I would have more knowledge about IT and be more confident in
                    utilising it. The semester has got me to experience Python which I am very fond of. It is more modernised and easily
                    accessible, giving me the basic knowledge to be able to adapt to a more advanced language. I would also like to do
                    more research on my own about web designing and cloud computing as it intrigues me a lot.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <h1>Senior Developer</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="pp">
                My first goal would be to master one programming language which in my interest is currently Python. From then, I
                would like to study more coding languages on my own or offered in my IT course at University. My goal is to take a
                Minor in Cloud Computing, so I would be proficient enough to be able to develop my own cloud ecosystem. Because the
                idea of having all of your important files on the go is convenient and productive. Having to be able to improve upon
                that, also getting cloud services more consumer-friendly and encouraging more people to utilise them in their daily
                lives. Another segment I want to explore is web development intrigues me and creating beautiful and practical
                websites is a strong skill to have. As such, joining a larger project at University would have a massive impact on
                my future career goal.
                To achieve my desire, I think first I need to participate in an internship during my study to get real experience
                and to be able to work with different people and employers. Hence, I would experience what it is really like to do
                real work and learn more about the IT industry. During this internship, I want to improve my communication and
                networking skills while learning how things operate in this field. After having enough knowledge in my IT program
                and through the experience gained in my internship, I want to look for the opportunity to apply to a company to
                start working and learn new things to start as a Junior Developer. Moreover, to be able to become a project manager,
                I need to improve my leadership skills in order to become a Senior Developer leading my own projects later on. From
                then, I would do my own research to branch out into different sectors of the IT world and challenge myself to either
                start my own company or earn a remarkable achievement.
                Another important aspect of my career plan is the personal development process. I plan to learn the necessary skills
                to be able to create what I love such as generating innovative and new ideas. Proving myself that I can overcome
                obstacles and solve problems by thinking outside the box. Showing future employers my capabilities and how I would
                improve upon myself with the knowledge I gained.

                <h2 style="text-align:center ;">(s3938143)</h2>
                <p class="ppp">My name is Bao, I am 20 years old and from the Uzumaki Team. I am currently a first-year student at
                    University. In my many years of travelling around the world, I have experienced diverse ethnic encounters. I am
                    proud to be a trilingual person, with fluency in Vietnamese, English, and French. I am a timid person that enjoys
                    learning and discovering new things and a very hard worker. In addition, while I was in middle school, I won the
                    Silver Medal in a District Table Tennis tournament.
                    Whenever I have spare time, I tend to watch random interesting concepts that I am not familiar with, as well as
                    tutorials on how to accomplish things. I occasionally play video games with my friend and sometimes with strangers
                    on the internet. Playing games with foreigners on the internet has helped me improve my English and confidence in my
                    communication. Also, whenever I feel stressed and overwhelmed, I play table tennis for fun, relaxation and
                    decompress.
                    My first impression of the IT machine is when I saw the AI that accompanied the protagonist as a hologram for the
                    first time when I first watched "Blade Runner 2049." It is the first time I was fascinated and had a thought of how
                    I can make something like that happen. Then I realised all I have to do is to glue four small pieces of plastic
                    together into a square with the bottoms of four rows bunched together, then place it on the iPhone screen with a
                    moving image of something that splits in four with the bottoms of four rows bunched together, creating a space
                    between them. From that tinkering, I have found out that I want to learn machine learning so I can improve it by
                    removing the plastic component and making it look more advanced with more functions.
                    To be honest, I may not have much experience with IT, but I am a guy who picks things up quickly. I have a strong
                    will and never give up on anything. I start to work on it, so I figured that by the time I finished my education, I
                    would have a better grasp and become more confident in handling it.

            <h1>Hologram Technologist</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="pp">
                When I was a boy, I dreamt of inventing something that would make others marvel at me. Until I saw a scene in the
                movie "Blade Runner" during which a hologram of a girl could wander freely around the room without any equipment
                other than a little projector. That is the moment when I realised I had to achieve the impossible: Create a
                real-life hologram device that can move freely as well as act like a human. But now that I have grown up and am
                looking back at my younger self, I realise that it was all just a special visual effect in the movie. With our
                current technological advancements, complex hologram technology is still unachievable and sounds like a far dream.
                That is why I was put on this earth: To do the impossible, to improve our advancement in hologram technology.
                There are several reasons I chose this career path. First of all, I adore facing any life's challenges. Perhaps one
                of my greatest hobbies is facing obstacles, finding ways to overcome them, or at least learning one or two lessons
                from them. I figured out the concept of the hologram stuff and made a complete at-home hologram project when I was a
                teenager, so I am conversant with hologram technology if I have to say so. My former invention is plain, but it
                functions as a hologram in its own right and the only difficulty is that it is stationary and has no awareness. In
                addition, I am a fairly ambitious man. This means that even if I fail, the difficulties will never bore me because
                the outcome will still be a lesson I learned from my mistakes. I would relish the opportunity to learn new things
                because I enjoy and value experiences.
                Finally, I want to become a Hologram Technologist because I want to live out my dream of achieving the impossible. I
                am aware of the difficulties in this sector, but I am not afraid of the challenges at all. With the right person,
                the appropriate tools, and enough time, I believe my legacy will be accomplished. However, in order to get there, I
                need to finish my education first. I hope that after I graduate, I will be able to find a wonderful environment
                where I may get significant knowledge, make friends, and accomplish my dream. All of this is possible due to my
                potential, passion, and knowledge from my study at University.

                <h2 style="text-align:center ;">(s3818561)</h2>
                <p class="ppp">My name is Bui Ngan Ha and I am the only girl in the Uzumaki Team. Unlike the boys, I am in my senior year at University and studying a Bachelor of Tourism and Hospitality Management. During university, I have mastered multi-tasking skills, to be honest. At the same time, I can study in class, do assignments, go to work and join the club. I always try to keep myself busy because only this way would keep me efficiently contributing and experiencing the utmost of my student life.
                    Good hobbies could help me prepare better for my future and improve my quality of life. Sometimes, to distract me from a busy schedule for relaxation and regain energy, I enjoy dancing and singing karaoke with mom, chit-chatting with friends or lecturers, and especially travelling. I really love travelling not only for entertainment but also for new experiences and learning. Every trip I take is a footstep imprint on my life journey, as my father said. Because what I have left for the rest of my life is the value of what I have learned and experienced. Also the more I see the world, the more I understand the importance of technology to human beings, thereby I am fond of technology which could improve life quality better.
                    I was first impressed with many technological models at an innovative museum in Melbourne, Australia. The difference between traditional and current technology is the core of IT creates more functions for the modern machines. Moreover, I was also fascinated by the facial technology to check in and check out in the Vinpearl Hotel on Phu Quoc Island. Hence, I find out technology is actually interesting and sufficiently integrated into hotel operation to fasten its working process as well as prevent physical contact in this sensitive situation of Covid-19. Additionally, I usually help my parents with their phones and modern devices, making me realise that if I do not pursue IT, I would be left behind in the era of development.
                    To be honest, I have little experience in IT. I am more of a user than a creator of technology. I had only moderated hybrid events once by computer, monitor and master office documents for working.

            <h1 >Front-office Manager - The Ritz-Carlton</h1>
            <p class="pp">
                Before enrolling at University, I planned to study Business Information Systems major since many students in this
                major have received many interesting job offers from both business and technology entrepreneurs with high salaries
                and potential career development. Unfortunately that major is not available anymore so when I changed to learning
                Tourism and Hospitality, I also shifted my career goals to work in the hotel industry instead.
                My dream career is mainly in the front office at hotels, which is responsible for the interface and interaction with
                guests, maximising their experiences and satisfaction. Therefore, communication and solving-problems skills are
                required in my future job. The best way I could think of to improve those skills is to expand my networks in school
                and in the industry, seek senior tips and lecturer advice as well as try different activities around campus such as
                volunteering. It is also a better way to utilise my time at University to improve soft skills by practising
                presentation and speaking skills in front of classmates or teamwork collaboration in course projects.
                Furthermore, I will need to work on my technical skills. This is because the modern hotel operation has changed to
                become more systematic and sufficient with developed technology such as Property Management System (PMS) or Booking
                and Reservation System. I will need to learn more about hotel trends and other system support working in hotels by
                reading documentation and online resources such as Hospitality Net insights and industrial research about new
                technology to understand how it works and how to use it.
                Lastly, hands-on experiences are important for me to work in my ideal job as a Front-Office Manager. Besides
                finishing school projects, I will try to have a part-time job in the customer service field or join an internship
                last semester to gain real-work experiences. My university has nearly come to the end, however, it is still a long
                journey to reach my destination but I am confident that planning ahead and keeping track of the working process will
                help me succeed in the future

                    first-year student at University. I spent four years studying abroad in Canada and experienced a plethora of new
                    cultural experiences. I graduated from high school in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, which is a small city bordering the
                    U.S. In high school, I was on the badminton and soccer teams for three years, and I joined the badminton tournament
                    club; I did my best but didn't make it to the playoffs, but it was a fun and enjoyable time to make new friends from
                    another school.
                    When I have free time, I enjoy playing games such as CSGO and PUBG, as well as playing soccer with my teammates on
                    the field. When the pandemic hit, my school changed to online classes, and because I could not go outside, I spent
                    most of my time on the internet or playing video games. After a few months of being bored and depressed from not
                    being able to go outside, my friends and I decided to return to Vietnam for a couple of months because the school
                    still offers online classes. After graduating, I discovered that my heart desired to remain in Vietnam, so I applied
                    to University.
                    Since high school, I've been fascinated with Information Technology (IT). When I was watching YouTube videos and saw
                    a guy working on code and explaining how it works, how to code, what IT is, and what you can do in this industry, it
                    piqued my curiosity. I like the challenge of figuring out how computers worked, and I still enjoy learning about new
                    technology today. I have always been fascinated by computers and the Internet, and I intend to pursue a career as a
                    web developer after graduation. I have taken some basic programming classes by being involved in the robotics and
                    the computer scientists' club in high school, which have given me a basic understanding of the programming language
                    Python. I have also worked on a web project in Python, writing the code feature for the web as an example, which has
                    given me experience working with the web and building dynamic websites. I look forward to learning more about
                    Information Technology at University and continuing to grow my knowledge in the field. I would like to note that my
                    background in Information Technology is limited, but I am still in the process of learning and growing my knowledge
                    in the field.

            <p class="pp">
                Firstly, I have always been interested in computers and technology, hence I am going to finish my study at
                University with a Bachelor of Information Technology. Then, I will learn Mobile and Web Development minor can also
                help me write code to handle the specialised needs of the front-end, such as developing custom JavaScript libraries
                and frameworks, creating alternative user experiences for the web application, and creating bespoke HTML and CSS
                elements and code. Starting as a Web Developer, my role is to work alongside the Senior Full-Stack Developers to
                build the front-end and back-end portion of the application, which can include building out the user interface,
                creating the database models, storing procedures, and writing the code that powers the application functions.
                Finally, I could be responsible for maintaining the codebases as a Full-Stack Developer, creating new features from
                scratch, and troubleshooting and solving problems as they arise.
                There are many challenges on the journey and I still have a lot to learn at University in order to be successful in
                this field. I hope my years at University will be worthwhile so that I will gain more experience through challenges
                during studying and joining the on-site projects. From these experiences and knowledge, I can have a stronger
                background in working in IT and have a better chance to take several offers from my desired job in the future.

                <p class="ppp">My name is Vu Uy Lam, a member of the Uzumaki Team and a freshman at University. During four years of studying abroad in the US, I have experienced valuable experiences like joining the festival dance, learning a new culture, and participating in swimming competitions with other foreign participants although I got third place in that competition. However, those high school years were some of my most enjoyable memories.
                    I have a habit of reading novels whenever I have spare time. I always find myself in a quiet and peaceful place to enjoy reading and listening to music. Reading novels brings me a lot of benefits. It makes me feel relaxed and calm. After a hard-working day, I can relieve all my pressure just by reading books. I also learn new vocabulary items each time after reading, helping me improve my English efficiently. However, I want to find another hobby to enhance my knowledge and open an unlimited imagination. Therefore, I chose to study IT to explore my own potential and interest.
                    My passion for technology started in my childhood when I got to watch “Phineas and Ferb”, one of the famous cartoon TV series from Disney. I was impressed with all their inventions and the gadgets they created even though it was just an illusion. I am fond of technology because I want to use my skills, creativity and knowledge to make other people's jobs easier and more productive. 
                    I am a total freshman in Information Technology.  Although I just started with programming and technology in my first semester, I will try my best to not slow down the progress of the team. I do have some basics in Python and want to advance my knowledge to support my career and develop the technology in the future by studying programming related courses.

            <p class="pp">
                Since my earliest childhood, I have always been interested in computers and technology due to my favourite cartoon series named “Gundam”. Since then, I have always wanted to implement those fantasy ideas in cartoons. My first program was “Adding Two Numbers” using code, which made me seek to know about computers in deep learning. I am always trying to find the workflow of computing deep learning, even though this subject is difficult and would take me a long time to learn how to do them. I believe that basic knowledge of computers is an important tool that is applied in the current world to succeed, as it mitigates the challenges that are faced in life. 
                I would like to have a deep comprehension of machine learning during my study at University, which allows programs that can be easily updated and modified to adapt to new environments and tasks more quickly and efficiently. Although I am aware it is required to be adapted to new technology and can not be done in just one time, I need to be proactive in developing my skills and knowledge. By studying machine learning, I will have a deep comprehension of the digital revolution where no one is concerned about sickness, financial issues, or war.
                Furthermore, I have always considered learning to be important, and I will study constantly in order to be at the forefront of my field. Since I decided to pursue my dream as a Software Engineer, I should be aware of the latest technology and ongoing research, and apply my knowledge to the work. After completing a Bachelor of Information Technology, I will be well equipped with a variety of skills and knowledge. As I have more knowledge and a variety of skills in computer science, it will help me to get a better job. Following graduation, I am confident that I will get a position as a Software Engineer in a high-tech company.

    <h1>Career Comparison</h1>
    
    <p class="pp">Our team members include Thang’s ideal job as a Full-Stack Developer, Minh as a Senior Developer, Bao as a Hologram
        Technologist, Vu as a Software Engineer and Ha as Front-Office Manager. Although we have different goals and career
        paths, all of us recognize the importance of gaining fundamental knowledge and hands-on experience when studying at
        University. Bao plans to self-study in the hologram and experiment with this advanced technology to have hands-on
        experiences achieving his dream. Vu, on the other hand, plans for further research into machine learning to
        understand the root of system design aiming in the software engineering area. During school time, Thang will try on
        coding application projects to understand the process of building codebases in order to achieve his dream job.
        Minh’s plan is quite similar to Thang in developer career path but Minh aims for a leading position so he will try
        to have real-job experience through an internship in production projects, the more he understands both front-end and
        back-end processes and the network, the better he can work up to project leader. Since both Minh and Ha pursue
        managerial roles, they are active in joining school activities to expand their network and urge to improve their
        leadership skill, however, Ha is fond of following the hospitality industry so she will start as a receptionist in a
        hotel, which is different from other members.
