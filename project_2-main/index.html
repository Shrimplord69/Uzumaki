                                After many discussions, we came up with a team name in the Japanese language. “Uzumaki” means a whirlpool containing different elements inside it but always moving together. The initial concept of this name is for our prototype as it is a marketplace that gathers several sellers on a platform but all share the same targeted segmentation. However, the name also has a special meaning representing our team nature. Even though we have members from different majors, different educational backgrounds and ages, we are all willing to work together and support each other to come up with the possible ideas and best outcome. By doing that, we understand each member's weaknesses and strengths to contribute the right value thriving on advantages as a team.

                            Our group did amazing work since everyone committed to finishing quality work and keeping track of each phrase and new changes. Minh was in charge of web development, Thang supported Minh in researching information to enhance the prototype. Bao was in charge of collecting ideas and analysing the markets. Ha broke down the project into stages for easy following tasks with the support from Vu. In this Assignment, we should have improved on our time management, but we do not have the intention to change any working roles because everyone was ready to contribute their best in any allocated tasks.

    <br>
    <p class="pp">Our team members include Thang’s ideal job as a Full-Stack Developer, Minh as a Senior Developer, Bao as a Hologram Technologist, 
        Vu as a Software Engineer and Ha as Front-Office Manager. Although we have different goals and career paths, all of us recognize the importance of gaining fundamental knowledge and hands-on experience when studying at RMIT University. 
        Bao plans to self-study in the hologram and experiment with this advanced technology to have hands-on experiences achieving his dream. Vu, on the other hand, plans for further research into machine learning to understand the root of system design aiming in the software engineering area. 
        During school time, Thang will try on coding application projects to understand the process of building codebases in order to achieve his dream job. 
        Minh’s plan  is quite similar to Thang in developer career path but Minh aims for a leading position so he will try to have real-job experience through an internship in production projects,
        the more he understands both front-end and back-end processes and the network, the better he can work up to project leader. Since both Minh and Ha pursue managerial roles, they are active in joining school activities 
        to expand their network and urge to improve their leadership skill, however, Ha is fond of following the hospitality industry so she will start as a receptionist in a hotel, which is different from other members.
